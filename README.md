# CryptSecure
**Problem Statement**

Take the input from user for the plain text. Encrypt the data using DES in CBC mode.

Deliverables(Part-I):
```
• Implement the encryption/decryption process.
• Key generation.
```

Deliverables(Part-II):
```
• Generate RSA key pairs for encryption and decryption.
• Implement secure key exchange and communication between users.
• Perform simulated cryptographic attacks (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle, Denial-of-Service) to
evaluate the robustness of the implemented algorithm.
```
